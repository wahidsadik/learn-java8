## Learn Java 8 by doingMy goal is bring myself up to date with Java 8 features.Currently, I am reading these books/articles:- https://github.com/winterbe/java8-tutorial- http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Java-Programming-Brett-Spell/dp/1484206428/I plan to take a peak at these too:- http://www.amazon.com/Java-Action-Lambdas-functional-style-programming/dp/1617291994/- http://www.amazon.com/Java-Lambdas-Functional-Programming-Masses/dp/1449370772/So far I've identified few things to study/master:- Lambda, Function Reference, Functional Interface- Default and static methods- Stream, map, reduce, collection, parallel processing- Optional- Date/Time API- What else?
